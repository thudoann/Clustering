# Clustering the  phi and psi angle combinations in protein

* The distribution of phi and psi combinations.


* Used the K-means clustering method to cluster the phi and psi angle combinations with the value of k is based on the histogram of the distribution and by using **elbow** method. 


* Because of the periodic attributes of phi and psi, we shifted the data for better clustering.

* Compare the clusters found by DBSCAN with those found using K-means.
